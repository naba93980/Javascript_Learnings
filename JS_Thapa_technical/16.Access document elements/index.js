/*
Document.getElementById()

    Returns an object reference to the identified element. (An object reference is information on how to find a particular object. The object is a chunk of main memory; a reference to the object is a way to get to that chunk of memory. The variable str does not actually contain the object, but contains information about where the object is. Objects are created while a program is running. Each object has a unique object reference, which is used to find it. When an object reference is assigned to a variable, then that variable says how to find that object.)
